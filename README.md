# Deep-Learning-based-Ovarian-Cancer-Prediction-and-Classification-Using-Histopathology-Images
This project uses a deep learning model based on InceptionV3 to classify ovarian cancer histopathology images into Serous, Endometrioid, Mucinous, and Clear Cell subtypes. A Flask-based web app allows image upload or camera capture and provides probability-based predictions to support faster and more reliable diagnosis.
